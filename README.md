# create-flowmo

Scaffold an OutSystems-aligned vibe coding project with screens, a local SQL database, logic flows, and built-in agent skills for AI-assisted prototyping.

`create-flowmo` is the starting point of the Flowmo ecosystem. It sets up everything an AI agent needs to understand and assist you within the OutSystems paradigm — from file structure to expert skills.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-flowmo
```

Or equivalently:

```bash
npm create flowmo
```

You'll be prompted for a project name, target platform (O11 or ODC), and app type. All three can be passed as arguments to skip the prompts:

```bash
# Positional argument skips the name prompt
npx create-flowmo my-project

# Flags skip their respective prompts (any combination works)
npx create-flowmo my-project --odc --reactive
npx create-flowmo my-project --o11 --mobile
npx create-flowmo --odc          # prompts for name and app type
npx create-flowmo my-project --mobile  # prompts for platform only
```

**Platform flags:** `--odc` (OutSystems Developer Cloud), `--o11` (OutSystems 11)  
**App type flags:** `--reactive` (Reactive Web App), `--mobile` (Mobile App)

The CLI then scaffolds a project with:

- `screens/` — `.visual.html` starter screen with OutSystems UI layout
- `database/` — `schema.sql`, `seeds.sql`, and a `sql/` folder for `.sql` and `.advance.sql` files
- `tests/` — vitest query tests, including a reference test showing the canonical `--json` pattern
- `docs/` — flowmo standards (query testing) referenced from `AGENTS.md`
- `logic/` — Universal logic flowcharts (Client, Server, Service, or Data Actions)
- `scripts/` — Custom scripts
- `theme/` — OutSystems UI CSS and custom theme
- `.agents/skills/` — **Agent Skills**: Pre-packed expert knowledge (compliant with [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)) that teaches AI agents how to build for OutSystems.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` — a bridge for Claude Code, which only auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` (not `AGENTS.md`) and only scans `.claude/skills/` (not `.agents/skills/`). `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` via `@AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills` — one source of truth, no duplicated files.


## After Scaffolding

```bash
cd my-project
npm install
npx flowmo db:setup   # provision the local PGLite database
npx flowmo db:seed    # insert seed data
npm run dev
```

The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for local development with hot reload.

## The Workflow

`create-flowmo` is the starting point of the Flowmo ecosystem. Once scaffolded, the project is designed to work with two VS Code extensions:

- **[Visual Inspector](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowmo.flowmo-visual-inspector)** — opens `.visual.html` screen prototypes in a live preview with a layer panel for inspecting the element hierarchy.
- **[Flowchart Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowmo.flowmo-flowchart-editor)** — opens `.flowchart.md` logic flows in a visual drag-and-drop editor with bidirectional sync.

Install both at once with the **[Flowmo Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowmo.flowmo-extension-pack)**.

The scaffolded project also includes Copilot skills that understand OutSystems UI patterns, SQL conventions, and server action structure — so AI-generated code stays compatible with the platform.
